# üéµ NightcoreK Bot (Beta)

**‚ö†Ô∏è This is a beta version of the README. More detailed documentation will be added in the future.**

NightcoreK is a simple bot that transforms original audio files into nightcore-style music. It leverages the power of **GStreamer** for audio processing and is built using the **Meson** build system.

## üìã To-Do List

This project is still in early development. Here are planned features and improvements:

- [ ] **Add machine learning-based nightcore creation**  
      Use ML models to automatically generate optimal pitch and tempo adjustments.
- [ ] **Add video visualizer for output music**  
      Generate accompanying visuals for the nightcore tracks to create shareable music videos.
